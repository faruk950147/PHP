Loop Rules (Very Important)

Rule 1
    A loop starts with an initial value.

Rule 2
    The condition is checked before every iteration.

Rule 3
    If the condition is true, the loop body executes.

Rule 4
    After executing the loop body, the update (increment/decrement) happens.

Rule 5
    If the condition becomes false, the loop stops.

Nested Loop Rules (Very Important)
    Rule 1
        When the outer loop runs once, the inner loop runs completely.

    Rule 2

        The outer loop does not move to the next value until the inner loop finishes.

    Rule 3

        For every new value of the outer loop, the inner loop starts again from the beginning.

    Rule 4

        The outer loop controls how many times the process repeats.
        The inner loop controls what happens in each repetition.

    Rule 5 (Interview Line)

        For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop executes fully.

        Simple Formula
        Total operations = outer loop × inner loop
